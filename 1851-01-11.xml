                    <p>We have just received the Anglo Chinese Calendar for 1851,* it contains as
                        usual a great variety of useful information.</p>
                    <p>We select the few following Chinese Proverbs:</p>
                    <p>“ Not to distinguish properly between the beautiful and ugly, is like
                        attaching a dog’s tail to a squirrel's body.</p>
                    <p>An avaricious man, who can never have enough, is as a serpent wishing to
                        swallow an elephant.</p>
                    <p>While one misfortune is going to have another coming, is like driving a tiger
                        out of the front door, while a wolf is entering the back.</p>
                    <p>To ride a fierce dog to catch a lame rabbit (Useless power over a
                        contemptible enemy.</p>
                    <p>To attack a thousand tigers with ten men; to attempt a difficulty with
                        incommensurate means.)</p>
                    <p>To cut off a hen’s head with a battle-axe; (unnecessary valor.)</p>
                    <p>To instigate a villain to do wrong, is like teaching a monkey to climb
                        trees.</p>
                    <p>A pigeon sneering at a rock;—a mean man despising a prince.</p>
                    <p>The fish sports in the kettle, but his life will not be long.</p>
                    <p>Like a sheep dressed in a tiger’s skin is a superficial scholar.</p>
                    <p>Like a cuckoo in a magpie’s nest, is one who enjoys another’s labor.</p>
                    <p>Do not pull up your stockings in a melon field, or arrange your hat under a
                        peach tree, lest people think you are stealing.</p>
                    <p>By a long journey we know a horse’s strength; so length of days shows a man’s
                        heart”</p>

                    <p>The first part of the last seven days continued fine weather; Monday and
                        Tuesday being damp and disagreeable, followed on Wednesday and to-day by
                        hard frost. The average temperature of the week has been very nearly that of
                        the corresponding week of last year: in 1850 the mercury standing at 38.6°,
                        and during the past week at 39.2°.</p>

                    <head>John Dugdale</head>
                    <p>The topic of the week in our little community, has been the detention of the
                        John Dugdale, on the ground of some part of the Tea cargo not having paid
                        the legal duty. We arc happy to have in our power to lay before our readers
                        the detail of this occurrence and the correctness of which we think cannot
                        he contested, our information being derived from parties wholly cognisant of
                        the circumstances and whose characters will guarantee full credence to the
                        statement. The cargo of the John Dugdale, consists wholly of Tea shipped by
                        four parties, the duty receipts preparatory to clearing the vessel were
                        forwarded to her consignees on Saturday last, and on reference thereto they
                        found, that the vessel was about to clear with a cargo of about half the
                        quantity she had taken on her previous voyage. It should he mentioned that
                        no part of the cargo was shipped by the Consignees of the vessel. The Port
                        Clearance had been granted and forwarded to the Consul when the Consignees
                        of the vessel arrived at the Consulate and laid an information against the
                        several shippers by this vessel alleging that they had one and all smuggled
                        the greater part of the cargo and demanded the Consul’s interference in
                        order to visit upon the offenders the full penalties of their wrong
                        doing—the Consignee, moreover, lodged a formal protest against any damages
                        oc-curing to the ship in consequence of the legal duties not having been
                        paid, and late in the same evening, the several shippers were served with a
                        notice that they were held responsible for any losses arising from detention
                        of the ship, by any irregularity in payment of duties. No other course
                        consistent with his official duty could be pursued by Her Majesty's Consul
                        than that adopted by him on this occasion ; he immediately communicated with
                        the Taoutai and returned the grand chop, and as the vessel had been
                        permitted in the meantime to drop down below the anchorage, a messenger was
                        sent to seal the hatches and she was ordered back off the Chinese
                        Custom-house.</p>
                    <p>On reference to the manifest as given by the Consignees to the Consul, it was
                        found (after the grand chop had been issued) that there was a deficiency of
                        2,000 chests on which no duty whatever had been paid ; no intimation of this
                        discrepancy had been hinted at or pointed out by the Consignee to the party
                        interested, who on ascertaining the omission applied on the</p>
                    <p>earliest occasion to the Custom-house and tendered "the duty"; it was refused
                        on the plea that the accounts of the John Dug-dale had been closed, and the
                        vessel "had cleared. In the meantime the Consul had been in communication
                        with the Taoutai and it had been intimated to the parties concerned, that
                        the whole cargo would-be landed and re-weighed and such portion -thereof on
                        which it should appear that the duty had been evaded, should be confiscated
                        by the Chinese authorities.Subsequent-ly,—thanks to the judicious
                        intervention of the Consul, it was determined not to discharge the cargo,
                        and it was deemed by him, that this was not a case which merited the
                        infliction of the penalties arising under the Imperial treaty, seeing that
                        the laxity or corrupt connivance of the Customs-house officers has led to
                        such a state, that non-payment of the full duty upon Teas has now become the
                        custom of the port ; so much so, that even in this case of the John Dugdale
                        (with the deficiency of</p>
                    <p>2,000 chests on which no duty whatever was paid and others in which one sixth
                        and on third only was paid), still paid in respect of her tonnage, more
                        export</p>
                    <p>duty than 3/4ths of the vessels recently</p>
                    <p>We feel certain that our readers will heartily approve of the Consular
                        decision in this case, which was, that the shippers should declare the
                        respective quantities shipped and be amerced by the infliction of double
                        duties on the quantity not previously paid, and a further fine for their
                        irregularity, of 100 dollars each, to the Queen.</p>
                    <p>We sincerely hope that this Consular decision will be accepted as a warning
                        for the future, and we think we know enough of the right-mindedness and
                        correct feeling of our readers to say that the great lenity accorded in this
                        instance to the offending parties, will not be construed into the belief
                        that the Chinese authorities will be as apathetic and indifferent as they
                        have been of late, to the daily (we might say hourly) systematic evasions,
                        of the legal duties both in imports and exports,—sorry should we be, that
                        such a state of things, should permanently obtain in this recent but rising
                        port as has disgraced Canton from time immemorial. We are assured by the
                        best informed of our friends that it is not only inexpedient, but absolutely
                        expensive in its results to the shipper ; as it has been satisfactorily
                        proved that any evasion of the duties has led to a more than corresponding
                        augmentation of the cost laid down in England.</p>
                    <p>We shall on a future occasion return to this subject, one of prominent
                        interest, and in the proper understanding of which the best interests of
                        this port, moral and social, are most intimately connected.</p>
                    <p>Since the foregoing was written we learn that the duties and fines have been
                        paid and the John Dugdale has proceeded on her voyage. If all Consignees of
                        vessels will have the high moral courage to inform against the
                        irregularities in other people’s shipments, there will soon be an end to all
                        illicit trading.</p>

                    <head>Lady Mary Wood</head>
                    <p>The Lady Mary Wood sailed for Hongkong on Sunday last ; and currency has been
                        given to a report that this will be her last voyage, as the Peninsular and
                        Oriental Company propose discontinuing the Shanghae line, unless the
                        mercantile community come forward with a standing subsidy in its aid.- It
                        may indeed be the Steamer’s last voyage, as we believe she is required for
                        some other of the Company’s branch lines ; but that this body contemplates
                        abandoning its footing in Shanghae, whatever may be the response of the
                        public to this novel demand, is a result of which we are more than
                        sceptical. To do so would be at once to call competitors into the field,
                        either English or American, who in the process of time might follow the
                        expansive policy of the Company itself ; and far from contenting themselves
                        with cast off coasting branches, seek a share of the profits attached to
                        main lines and introduce a wholesome rivalry into the whole scheme of
                        Oriental Steam Navigation. It may require cautious consideration before the
                        Company extends its operations to any given locality ; but once established
                        there we are much mistaken if it wilL see fit to abandon whatever prospects
                        may have been entertained and whatever progress made, unless indeed in the
                        improbable event of the enterprise turning out so worthless and hopeless,
                        that no sane speculator would think of stepping into the vacated
                        position.</p>
                    <p>But it is alleged that the Company are losing money by the extension of their
                        line to Shanghae. If this really be the case, we regret it sincerely ; but
                        can hardly admit that the question is thus dis-posed of. The experiment has
                        scarcely existed for a year, and twelve months are an insufficient time to
                        prove whether it be profitable or not. Nothing is more certain than that in
                        the great facilities which modern science has afforded to communication and
                        locomotion, their invariable tendency has been not only to develope but to
                        create traffic; and it is from the new sources thus opened up that these
                        costly enterprizes have derived in</p>
                    <p>a great measure their remuneration. Now we are more hopeful of the destinies
                        of this port than to imagine for a moment we have yet fathomed the extent of
                        its capabilities. Every year increases the magnitude of its stated trade,
                        and every year is developing something new in that trade’s special features.
                        Every year consequently is rendering it more fitted to support effectively a
                        rudiment of Steam Navigation on the Chinese Coast and to remunerate better
                        by the unforced expansion of commerce the pioneers of such an undertaking.
                        Nor is it to be forgotten that in the particular operations of the
                        Peninsular and Oriental Company the great value of the Shanghae branch is as
                        a feeder to the main lines ; and in a comprehensive view of its pecuniary
                        results should be estimated not only the limited earnings of the coasting
                        Steamer but the returns from passengers and freight transferred by it to the
                        Indian and English vessels, neither of which in many instances would have
                        gone forward, but for the facilities afforded by a Steam communication
                        throughout. If in the combination of these ultimate results with its. direct
                        and immediate returns the Shanghae line is still a failure and likely to
                        remain so,</p>
                    <p>we confess that we are much surprized at</p>
                    <p>the event.</p>
                    <p>At this juncture, then, the Company institutes a demand of one thousand
                        dol-lars or so per month from the mercantile body here. It is true that no
                        reason is given, and that the exaction is delicately regarded as a postage
                        charge for the conveyance of letters ; but there can be no mistaking its
                        unusual character. We presume the step has been taken in pursuance of
                        instructions from head quarters; for the Company’s Agents in China could, we
                        are satisfied, have given them much better advice as to what would he
                        palatable to their supporters here, and beneficial to the best interests of
                        their own body. We know not whether a similar demand will he made upon
                        merchants at Hongkong, the other terminus of the line ; but at both places
                        the matter must very soon be settled in one way or the other. We cannot
                        suppose that either community will view with much complacency this attempt
                        to tax them by a monthly subscription, though it may be difficult to decide
                        whether they should seriously resent it or feel inclined rather to be amused
                        at the originality of the idea. Certainly, of all the paltry expedients to
                        which virtue in distress can be reduced we think the most undignified
                        spectacle is that of a great commercial incorporation "sending round the
                        hat,” as it has been proposed to do in the present case by the Peninsular
                        and Oriental Company.</p>
                    <p>Let this undertaking, like every other, stand upon its own basis. If the line
                        is not renumerating let the Company apply to Government for its assistance
                        by a Post Office contract for the mails, as has been done in other instances
                        all over the globe ; and if Government is obdurate to a well authenticated
                        representation of this nature, let the concern be decently abandoned. But we
                        can only regard the principle of a direct (and as far as lies in the power
                        of a private body, an enforced) assessment-upon the public of any locality
                        for the support of an undertaking in which they are but indirectly concerned
                        as inherently vicious. What would be thought at home of the modesty of a
                        railway company in difficulties which should seek to levy contributions for
                        its own private advantage on every parish, through which its line might pass
                        under a threat of stopping the conveyance of parcels or some other branch of
                        traffic ? Or what of an insolvent trader who should send a circular to his
                        creditors that unless they contributed so much a month to keep him afloat he
                        would be under the unfortunate necessity of failing outright? We are
                        certainly indebted to the Peninsular and Oriental Company for that more
                        intimate connection with Europe which is the natural result of a direct
                        Steam Navigation thence ; but we do not think that body has always been
                        actuated by the most liberal sentiments or given effect to these in the most
                        liberal way. It should occasion little surprize therefore if their present
                        appeal to the mercantile body meets with a tardy and unwilling response ;
                        and we await the issue of the proposal at all events with some curiosity. So
                        far arc we, however, from regarding with apprehensions of its success the
                        extension of Steam Navigation to this quar-ter, that we conceive in a very
                        short time nothing less will meet the requirements of Shanghae than making
                        it the terminus of the Bombay line, and Hongkong only the port of call. Drug
                        will then be brought on without the necessity of transhipment with its
                        attendant delay and risk, and we shall enjoy the advantage of a Steamer for
                        each incoming and each outgoing mail. It might he well for the Peninsular
                        and Oriental Company to anticipate this time, at least to facilitate its
                        realization, certainly not to interpose such clumsy obstructions as that
                        which we have noticed to the enlarged spirit of commercial enterprize and
                        liberal dealing which should accompany the magnitude of their
                        operations.</p>

                    <p>Decrees and Rescripts.</p>
                    <p>None of the ten Decrees given in this number treat on any subject worthy of
                        notice; we therefore pass on to the memorials, of which there are two,
                        addressed to His Majesty severally by Keying and by Lew Yunko, (Viceroy of
                        Fuhkeèn and Che-keang. )</p>
                    <p>Keying entreats His Majesty to permit him to retire from his office promising
                        when totally restored to health to “ lay his head in the mire at “ the
                        Palace Gate, and crave to be again employed.” He thanks the Emperor for
                        leave of absence which has been repeatedly granted him, and for the Gracious
                        attention which has been vouchsafed to him in his ailments, and mourns that
                        diligent exertion in the sphere of duty allotted to him, (which is the only
                        means at his disposal of showing his ferment gratitude,) is totally out of
                        his power. He speaks of the grievous ulcer that broke out in his neck, while
                        on service at Tsing-keang in the spring of last year, and states that his
                        medical adviser is of opinion that the constant drain of such a chronic
                        sore, is sufficient to undermine his constitution and unfit him for all</p>
                    <p>exertion either of mind or body. He therefore</p>
                    <p>as a last resource, sends his memorial by the hand of his son, and beseeches
                        that the Imperial Glance may be bestowed thereon.</p>
                    <p>Memorials.</p>
                    <p>Lew Yunko of Fuhkeen and Chekang writes as follows :—</p>
                    <p>"Hangchang, Intendant of Circuit of Hinghwa,</p>
                    <p>Tseuenchow and Yungchun, (Taoutai at Amoy,) applied for leave last year to
                        visit the Capital and obtain an audience, and afterwards falling ill at
                        Peking, he left the service altogether. In consequence of which I received
                        Your Majesty's instructions, directing me, as the post was one of extreme
                        importance, to select an officer to fill the vacancy from among the whole
                        number of Intendants in the Province, and to appoint Chang Hcyu to the
                        office for the time being.”</p>
                    <p>“ The Intendant of Hinghwa, Tseuenchow, and Yngchun is I find placed over two
                        primary departments and one secondary, comprising a tract of country
                        situated in the southernmost extremity of Fuhkeen, and inhabited by a race
                        of people who are obstinate and preverse, and indeed, proverbially difficult
                        to govern. The town in which he holds his official residenoe, Amoy, is the
                        most important sea port in the entire province, and the seat of its naval
                        Command ; and being a great resort of all the mercantile marine of China, it
                        presents no sinecure to the authorities who have to keep its thousands under
                        subjection, and prevent the prevalence of crime. Ever since the
                        establishment of commercial intercourse with western nations in the 23rd
                        year of the late reign, forests of barbarian ships have also frequented its
                        harbour ; England has placed a barbarian eye in the city and her vessels as
                        well as those of America and Spain have constantly made it their resort. The
                        civilised and the barbarian are thus thrown into constant collision,
                        facilities for their falling out with each other naturally present
                        themselves, and thus call for increased anxiety on the part of the
                        authorities in charge. To secure good management under these circumstances
                        and prevent all risk of failure, it is I conceive absolutely necessary that
                        an officer of uncompromising dignity, and possessing a thorough know-, ledge
                        of the barbarian language should be the person selected for this port
                        Bearing this in mind assisted by the Commissioner of Justice and Finance, I
                        have carefully weighed the capabilities of every individual Intendant of
                        Circuit in the province, and really have not been able to discover cue at
                        all suited to the situation, and therefore, fearing evil consequences, have
                        not filled up the vacancy in that way ; Chang Heyu, the individual at
                        present officiating is a Tsinsze of Szechuen, and was promoted from a
                        district Magistracy in Kwangtung to the Prefectship of Nanning in Kwangse.
                        When Seu Keyu Governor of Fuhkeen was Commissioner of Justice at Canton in
                        the 23rd year of Taoukwang, he had constant opportunities of meeting this
                        officer, then Magis-rtate of Pwanyu Ileen, and he found him to be not only a
                        literary character but also a most clear headed able and experienced man,
                        besides which he observed that he possessed an intimate knowledge of the
                        Barbarian disposition. Taking into consideration the necessity of selecting
                        an officer qualified for his post where, as in this irstance, the peculiar
                        interests of a post of foreign trade, are concerned, and the fact that no
                        other person besides Chang Heyu can be found possessing equal experience of
                        the barbarians and their habits, I feel it my duty after consultation with
                        the Commissioners of Justice and Finance to request Your Majesty in
                        consideration of the importance of the office of Intendant of Circuit of
                        these maritime districts, and the interests of the country comprised therein
                        to permit Heyu to fill the vacancy.”</p>

                    <head>To the Editor of the North China Herald</head>
                    <p>Mr. Editor,—In the North-China Herald of the 14th December last, it is
                        stated, that, if possible, the New Park will be completed in time for the
                        next Spring Meeting of our Racing Club ; now that so speedy a termination to
                        the exertions of the Committee who so kindly undertook the planning of the
                        New Course, seems scarcely probable, will you allow me through the medium of
                        your columns, to make a few suggestions respecting the much called for
                        improvement of the present Park?</p>
                    <p>The ground intended for the formation of a new ride for the Community has not
                        been taken possession of, so I presume that the actual settlement of it
                        remains still a question of time, and the period of its completion, for
                        either Riding or Racing purposes seems still more indefinite. I would
                        therefore suggest, that the original plan which now appears to be both more
                        expensive, and less easily accomplished, than was at first expected, be cast
                        aside for the present, and our wants he supplied in the following
                        manner.</p>
                    <p>For a good Racing and Riding ground suitable to our small Community, and</p>
                    <p>the horses used by them, I would pro-</p>
                    <p>pose that the Course be extended to the road leading from the village west of
                        the Fives Court to the Soochow Creek, en-circling the Plantation at the west
                        of the present Park, and forming the Course into a sort of oval, of which
                        the Fives Court should be at one end and the proposed addition be at the
                        other. The new portion either to be purchased entire, including all the land
                        inside the Course, or merely buy or rent the land on which the new ride is
                        formed, leaving the plantation &amp;e., in the hands of the present owners.
                        With such a course the coiners might be well rounded, and even Sydney and
                        Arab horses have full swing in their gallops.</p>
                    <p>As a good country road is a great desideratum, I would suggest that one might
                        be formed from the north west corner of the above proposed course, pass the
                        north side of the village west of the Fives Court to the creek which bounds
                        the Foreign ground over which let a new bridge be made (where the present
                        wooden one stands) and from that take the first foot path to the south,
                        widening it, and improving the small bridges until arrival at the "western
                        road" and let the ride continue on that road to the red Joss house near the
                        bubbling well ; and from it, return</p>
                    <p>along the north side of the creek that</p>
                    <p>runs east and west towards Shanghae, cross that creek about a quarter of a
                        mile before arriving at the large stone Bridge beside the fir plantation,
                        and continue east till arrived at the proposed new bridge over the creek
                        which bounds the Foreign ground, and from thence proceed home by the course.
                        e</p>
                    <p>From this circuit many good roads branch off, and it is only some small re
                        pairs to bridges that are required to make capital roads from it, to the
                        Pagoda by St. Catherine’s bridge to the French Mis-sionaries (Sze-kea-wei,}
                        Yah-ke tun, Fat-wha, &amp;e. Some compensation would be required for land
                        lost by the widening of small paths, but the amount would be trifling. </p>
                    <p>If the above suggestions were carried into effect we would have a safe road
                        of some five or six miles in extent, without a single paved village to pass
                        through and only one large bridge to cross ; I can not estimate the expense
                        of the improvements here suggested, but there is little doubt that all of
                        them could be carried out at a much less expense than the pro. posed new
                        Park, and I would even venture to say they would suit the wants of the
                        Foreign Residents much better, for we would have both a good course and a
                        safe country road quite completed in all probability before the new Park is
                        even commenced.</p>
                    <p>I hope these remarks will lead to further suggestions for the improvement of
                        country roads and that ere long we may be able to ride safely and
                        comfortably to some distance from Shanghae.—I am Mr. Editor, your most
                        obedient servant,</p>

                    <head>EXTRACT FROM “TEA AND TEA TRADE,’’ By Gideon Nye, Jr., of Canton. THE
                        QUESTION OF CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES. </head>
                    <p>In reverting to the consideration of the question of the consumption in this
                        country, we are always brought to the necessity of a more stable and uniform
                        market here ;—the prevention of rapid and great fluctuation of prices, out
                        of which spring the inducements to ship false and very inferior kinds of
                        tea, from the introduction of which a distaste arises, and the use is
                        checked.</p>
                    <p>The nature of this commerce, based as it is upon an article of prime
                        necessity, which is the production of but one country, and that a distant
                        one, and the extension of whose use follows so surely the diffusion of
                        knowledge, and conducted, as well in second as in first hands, by a
                        comparatively limited number of the most intelligent and respectable
                        merchants whilst its importation is almost confined to this port*, should
                        exempt it from the frequent and rapid fluctuations which coffee and other
                        products of many, and of near, as well as distant countries, whose
                        importation and sale is neither confined to a limited number of merchants,
                        or to any one port, are subject.</p>
                    <p>In reviewing the trade for the last period of five years, we find a
                        remarkable uniformity in its amount, as shown by the exports, from China
                        hither, which, for convenience, we now repeat the gross sums of. Thus, there
                        were shipped to "this country in—</p>

                    <p>Showing an average of about 14,323,000 pounds of green, and of about
                        4,9171,000 pounds of black ; and of both, 19,240,000 pounds per annum.—This
                        presents a</p>
                    <p>uniformity such as no other article of importation does for a like period,
                        and indicates a commerce free of the elements of fluctuation.</p>
                    <p>We find therefore, that the influences which have disturbed the course of
                        prices here are external, or of an imaginary nature, and that the remedy
                        lies in the adoption of a new system of sales, by which a regular and more
                        gradual offering of the annual and inevitable accumulation of the
                        importations in the spring may be provided for. As to the period of shipment
                        from China, the laws of nature control the operations of the merchant ; for
                        the incoming of the crop of tea at</p>
                    <p>the shipping ports is naturally in the autumn,</p>
                    <p>the monsoon soon after favours the vessel’s return hither; and the
                        approaching season of humidity does not less powerfully than the winds tend
                        to warn merchant against delay in China.</p>
                    <p>These natural and uncontrollable causes, then, indicate clearly the necessity
                        of the suggested remedy. The considerations of its expediency have already
                        been presented in the previous papers, in anticipation of the opening of the
                        spring trade here ; and the subsequent course of the</p>
