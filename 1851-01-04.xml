                    <head>From the San Francisco Daily Herald, September 7.</head>
                    <p>Norman Assing, “ Chief of the China Boys,” with a praiseworthy disposition to
                        have justice administered among his subjects in conformity with the laws and
                        by the authorities of their adopted country, appeared this morning before
                        his Honor the Recorder, to complain that Asseck, Arque and Assem had
                        committed an assault upon Ching Ching, during which they had damaged not
                        only his celestial body, but also its cerulean vestment ; and to have meted
                        out to them a proper punishment. His Honor was at first somewhat puzzled how
                        to administer the necessary oath to Ching Ching, the complain-</p>
                    <p>ing witness ; but Norman Assing offered to act as interpreter, and performed
                        the ceremony by means of a somewhat lengthy harangue, accompanied with
                        gestures very similar to their hieroglyphics, which was listened to by the
                        Court, the witness and all parties, in mute admiration. By the aid of the
                        same interpreter, the witness unfolded his tale, (we do not mean his long
                        queue,) at the conclusion of which his Honor sentenced the accused trio to a
                        fine of 5 dollars each, and one day’s residence among the in-side barbarians
                        of Captain Fallon’s lock-up ; also to contribute sufficient funds to replace
                        Ching Ching’s torn garment ; or, in the words of the decision, to robe him “
                        in statu quo ante bellum."</p>
                    <p>Norman Assing rejoiced at the equitable decision of the Court, and delivered
                        his belligerent subjects into the hands of Captain Beck, with sundry moral
                        maxims for them to reflect upon during their confinement.</p>

                    <head>The New Year</head>
                    <p>THE NEW YEAR.</p>
                    <p>The New Year has dawned promisingly upon us. We have squared accounts with A.
                        D. 1850. We start anew in life, we begin a new page of history, we enter
                        upon a year yet unsullied with blots and calamities. How refreshing is such
                        a break in the monotony of life, how beneficial such a fresh starting point
                        in the world’s race! How congenial to hope, how provocative of good
                        resolutions is a New Year!</p>
                    <p>In these our days when events unfold themselves with a rapidity and suddeness
                        that would have startled fair steadier slow going forefathers there is
                        something more than ordinary in the anticipative feelings with which we hail
                        a new year. We have seen what a single year has brought forth, we have seen
                        a year, aye a month, aye a day crowded with events big with importance which
                        in days of yore Would have been spread over a life time. With such
                        precedents before us, and with, the rations of the earth in no state of
                        torpor, we hold our breath in anxious suspense. What shall the year 1851 see
                        ? what shall its historian have to record ? The ceaseless progress of
                        science, the increasing rapidity of communication and facility of locomotion
                        all tend towards an acceleration of life in all its phases. The wonderful
                        activity of the human mind, starting, as it does, from the vantage ground of
                        the labours of all preceding mind, bent as it is in so many million
                        instances, upon the study and elucidation of the properties of physical
                        creation and the application of those properties to the alleviation of human
                        evil and the advancement of our race,—compels us to mingle no slight degree
                        of certainty with our anticipations. We know that at the close of -1851,
                        if-We have not to look back with</p>
                    <p>wonder and surprise upon mighty changes and convulsions in nations, we shall
                        have to look upon mightier manifestations of the principles good and evil
                        that are stalking through the earth, upon splendid discoveries in the
                        sciences, and upon the application of those discoveries for the well-being
                        of man. Let no one accuse us of usurping the Prophet's place in writing thus
                        : It is evident on the one hand that we have not attained the ulti-matum of
                        truth in any of its brandies political, forensic or scientific, the law of
                        finality evidently cannot yet be applied in the regions of mind and matter.
                        It is evident enough on the other hind that the days of mental slumber are
                        at an end, mind is fully awake and will work and will not be hindered ; it
                        is evident too that in a degree hitherto unknown, the labours of mind are
                        directed towards the practical, the useful, the beneficial, and that one.
                        glimpse of truth, one seeming lucky guess, may as often heretofore, open the
                        door to boundless fields of truth. Thus then with a rich mine only</p>
                    <p>partially, in how small a part ! explored, with millions of miners patiently
                        and intensity working, are we wrong in confidently expecting that, year by
                        year stores of rich gold should he brought forth for enriching the sons of
                        men ? No ! creation so richly endowed, With so many wondrous properties must
                        reveal her long closed secrets, must give up her stores for the use of man.
                        Constituted Lord of the earth at its creation, man is only now awaking to
                        the extent of his</p>
                    <p>dominion. A Beneficient</p>
                    <p> creator is leading him on and pointing how he may make the lightning his
                        messenger and all the elements his servants. </p>
                    <p>Heartily, then do we wish our readers, a happy new year.</p>

                    <p>No. 117, Oct. 20th and 21st, 1850.</p>
                    <p>Decrees and Rescripts.</p>
                    <p>The first Decree confers promotion and honor upon a number of the civil and
                        military officers of Shantung Promontory, for their success in an expedition
                        against some pirates, more than 500 of whom they have captured and
                        killed.</p>
                    <p>The second Decree also rewards certain military officers on the Mongolian
                        Frontier for similar zeal in the apprehension of daring robbers.</p>
                    <p>In the third Decree His Majesty anxious that his people should suffer as
                        little as possible from the effects of the procession about to he made to
                        escort the late Emperor's remains to the family tomb, commands that for
                        every mow of land trodden down by the cavalcade on their way from Pekin into
                        the Kift District, the sum of one mace of silver shall be paid out of the
                        Chihle Treasury, to enable the proprietors to purchase young shoots of wheat
                        wherewith to replant the ground. This they could easily do as the blade was
                        just then (the middle of the 9th month) shooting forth from the buried
                        seed.</p>
                    <p>The fourth Decree calls upon the ministers who are in charge of the road
                        along which His Majesty would travel on the 18th day of the 9th month to
                        escort his father’s remains, to be vigilant and watchful, and especially
                        careful that the path prepared for the purpose be not injured by the
                        chariots and horses of the officers and attendants who follow the
                        procession.</p>
                    <p>The next Decree commands the Viceroy of Chihle to publish an Imperial
                        Proclamation setting forth His Majesty's gracious intention to remit the
                        coming year’s taxes on the six Districts of Wahping, Leangheang, Cho,
                        Fangshan, Laeshwuy and as well as those of the present year, as an
                        extraordinary mark of his benevolence and goodness. These are the districts
                        through which the procession of the remains of the late Emperor would pass
                        on their way to the Imperial tombs. They lie in a S.W. direction from the
                        Capital, the furthest, Yih chow, being 220 le distant from Peking. •</p>
                    <p>The sixth Decree confirms the appointment of Kingtih to the military command
                        of the Lintsing division in Shantung.</p>
                    <p>The seventh Decree takes up a complaint made by the Board of War against the
                        Magistrate of Tungshan Hern in Keangsoo, for presuming, a-gainst the form of
                        the statute in such cases provided, to forward to Peking by Government
                        special courier, the application of a military graduate desirous of entering
                        himself for the metropolitan examinations; and His Majesty commands the
                        Governor of Keangsoo to ascertain why the Magistrate in question took upon
                        himself thus to put Government to this excessive and unnecessary
                        expenditure.</p>
                    <p>The last confirms a subordinate appointment in the censorate.</p>
                    <p>Memorials.</p>
                    <p>The first Memorial reports to the Emperor a case of forcible transit through
                        one of the Great Wall Barrier Gates on the part of some Mohammedan sheep
                        drivers wearing blue and white turbans, and carrying sticks and swords, in
                        order to avoid payment of the customary duty, and begs His Majesty to direct
                        the Board of Punishments to treat with the utmost rigour so flagrant a case
                        of contempt of authority.</p>
                    <p>The second Memorial informs His Majesty of the falling in of the roof of- one
                        of the pavilion temples in the Imperial Gardens of Tsinge yuen whereby the
                        right arm of a colossal statue of Budha has been broken off, and a number of
                        the surrounding idols severely injured, and the Memorialist begs that a
                        competent surveyor may be deputed to examine into the extent of the damage
                        done. </p>
                    <p>The last Memorial is from a censor advising His Majesty to call upon all his
                        provincial representatives to see the “constant granaries" in every district
                        and departmental town, properly filled up with grain. The primary object of
                        these Government granaries is to provide the people with grain at a reduced
                        and equable price at that particular time of the year when-“green has not
                        resolved itself into yellow ” or in the intervals between the crops, and
                        during times of scarcity and distress. Then when grain is again abundant and
                        the price low, it has to be purchased into store, to fill the granary for
                        future exigencies. These depositions are therefore called “ constant
                        stores.”</p>

                    <p>Every day rise early. The poems of the men Tang observe, when at home make it
                        your constant rule to rise early ; cherish deep anxiety for the welfare of
                        the nation, and heartily desire the year to be crowned with abundant
                        harvests.</p>
                    <p>It is important for those who are heads of families to be aware that if they
                        rise early, then which of the children of the family, younger brothers, or
                        domestics will dare lazily to sleep ? ' Each servant will then’give
                        attention to his own appropriate business ; diligence and economy will
                        predominate, and daily will be the increase</p>
                    <p>of prosperity and affluence. The calcula-</p>
                    <p>tions of each day depend upon the time between three and five o'clock in the
                        morning. Very early in the morning too, all the higher energies of the human
                        system are of doubly increased proportions. During these early hours, in the
                        study of books immense advantages are realized ; and during this space of
                        time too, a vast deal may meritoriously be effected. And furthermore, in the
                        family circle all miscellaneous matters should decidedly be arranged early

                    <head>REPORT ON THE MARITIME TRADE OF CHINA, AND THE PROSPECTS OF THE MORE
                        VALUABLE PORTION BEING Transferred TO FOREIGN BOTTOMS. </head>
                    <p>With the Polynesian Archipelago, in connection with the Dutch, Spanish, and
                        English colonies, a large trade is known to he carried on by the Chinese,
                        although the amount is variously estimated by different authorities. The
                        exports from China to Singapore alone in 1814, according to official
                        returns, amounted to 2,073, 233 dollars, and the imports into China
                        3,256,260; exports from China 1834-5 were 766,955, and the imports into
                        China 1,213,695 dollars. And up to the year 1843-4 the trade with that port
                        has been progressively increasing. With Cochin China, Siam, Corea, Japan,
                        and Formosa there is also a large though decreasing trade. The Junk trade
                        from the different Chinese ports along the coast is very great. Many causes
                        seem to be in operation, the tendency's of which is to divert a considerable
                        portion of the Chinese carrying trade to foreign bottoms. These tendencies,
                        both politically and commercially, may soon be productive of results of
                        great importance and are worthy of attention.</p>
                    <p>The history of this trade and its progress ; at Shanghae may equally serve I
                        believe with slight modification- for every other port in China.</p>
                    <p>The Junk-trade with Japan, Formosa, Siam, the Malabar coast, and the
                        Polynesian Archipelago generally, has sensibly deteriorated here of late
                        years, chiefly owing to the risk and losses incurred by piracy. From the
                        same cause great portion of the native Straits’ trade at Amoy, has we know
                        fallen into the hands of Europeans, and is carried on under the Spanish flag
                        on Chinese account.</p>
                    <p>The following-facts collected by a body of our merchants here for their own
                        use, bear out this view:—</p>
                    <p>" To the end of July in the year 1847, 4 junks only appear to have arrived
                        here from Siam of 8 to 9,000 piculs burden, bringing pepper, sandal wood,
                        mangrove bark, rattans, &amp;c. ; 5 from. Singapore of from 4 to 5,000
                        piculs, bringing in addition to the same articles, ebony, bicho de mar, and
                        sea-weed. The capture of a large Siam junk, and the detention of a Fokeen
                        junk from Formosa with 5,000 piculs of sugar, the latter held to ransom, was
                        currently reported at the same time. The Yang-tsze-keang for several Weeks
                        was kept in a state of blockade for Chinese vessels, by a fleet of piratical
                        junks.”</p>
                    <p>“ The trade from Manila which in former years employed several junks, and
                        latterly one annual junk, in 1847 gave employment exclusively to two Spanish
                        vessels, the Veloz and Cebuana, which were chartered and loaded with return
                        cargoes by Chinese, chiefly articles of Chinese use and consumption."</p>
                    <p>The adverse influences which have</p>
                    <p>tended so strikingly to curtail and injure</p>
                    <p>the native maritime trade of China, nearly destroying the Straits’ trade at
                        this port, hold out the promise of a speedy transfer of the more valuable
                        portion of that which remains to foreign bottoms, exempted from the dangers,
                        delays, and losses attending the voyages of the junks. The same causes which
                        have realized the promise at Amoy may be safely counted upon here.</p>
                    <p>In my report of the native trade of Foochow in the year 1846, I drew
                        attention to the fact that although 1,625 junks had entered, representing
                        some 120,000 tons of shipping, and a trade estimated at 16,000,000 dollars,
                        it was greatly curtailed by the risk from pirates having compelled the
                        merchants to resort to the more costly transit inland of all manufactured
                        goods, and the more portable articles of value. “Piracy,” I observed in
                        despatch of 3rd September, 1846, “seems on the increase, and seriously
                        damages and curtails the whole of the coast trade. The Chinese authorities
                        ap-pear to have little inclination and less power to put an end to this evil
                        ; and if our trade with the Consular ports be in any degree dependent upon

                        of the Mercantile Community, and contribute to the general convenience, and

                        af-fording that protection to the native trade which the Chinese cannot
                        themself provide, may be worthy of considera-tion.”</p>
                    <p>Efforts have since that date been made by Her Majesty’s Government to check
                        the piracy on the coast, and several captures it appears have been made by
                        Her Majesty’s Ship Scout. In winter, when large numbers of fishermen and sea
                        coast people are thrown out of employment there are few boats or men, I am
                        led to believe, not engaged in piracy whenever the opportunity can be
                        found.</p>
                    <p>The only remedy, therefore, which the nature of the case would seem to admit
                        lies in the substitution of foreign for Chinese bottoms, and the transfer of
                        the more valuable portion of the seaboard native trade into European hands.
                        The greatest gainers by this exchange would unquestionably be the bulk of
                        the Chinese nation, whose maritime trade, carried on in security and with
                        less cost, might safely be expected to take a large development</p>
                    <p>It is true a portion of the maritime population would more or less gradually
                        be thrown out of employment, the shipping interests might suffer by any
                        sudden transfer of capital, and the apparent prosperity of the native trade
                        would be diminished if estimated by the number of junks employed. But
                        shipment of the more valuable cargoes in foreign bottoms would speedily make
                        piracy in these seas less profitable, and thus by striking at the root of
                        the evil render the voyages of junks, laden with more bulky and less
                        available goods, comparatively safe. Moreover nothing is more certain than
                        the rapid deterioration of the Chinese maritime trade. The anticipated
                        result therefore, be it good or evil, will come under any circumstances, and
                        all the sooner if the alternative offered by foreign freight is rejected.
                        The only difference will be, that without the aid of our shipping the loss
                        comes unattended by any of the substantial advantages to the nation and the
                        shipping interests, which the em-ployment of foreign vessels in their trade
                        must of necessity bring, in compensation for a partial and temporary
                        evil.</p>
                    <p>The argument is still stronger in a political sense, for if the commercial
                        and military marine together be wholly unequal to grapple with the enemy
                        from which the maritime trade of China has long been suffering,—against
                        European aggression on their coasts, both the one and the other are and ever
                        have been utterly ineffective and powerless. The Chinese Empire therefore
                        may gain much in commercial wealth, but has nothing to lose in point of
                        military strength. Finally, the Chinese revenue would in many respects be
                        greatly benefited by a larger trade and less smuggling.</p>
                    <p>The only immediate advantage to Europe consists in the profitable employment
                        such a trade would afford for a large amount of tonnage ; but indirectly and
                        more remotely', by making the Whole Chinese Empire conscious of their
                        maritime weakness and dependence upon foreigners, for the safe and
                        profitable conduct of the native trade, the absurd arrogance and conceit of
                        this people continually endangering their relations with the civilized
                        nations of the West, might by such peaceable means he abated, and a better
                        feeling lend to that larger, less restricted, and more beneficial
                        intercourse, to which all things seem inevitably to tend, whether war or
                        commerce be destined to prepare the way.</p>
                    <p>I have not been able satisfactorily to ascertain the relative cost of
                        transport in Chinese and British vessels, it varies so much according to the
                        port, the season, and the partnership arrangements with the crew, that even
                        a close approximation is next to impossible. Assuming that it may be much
                        less in the junks, the grievous and notorious hazard of loss, by pirates,
                        the delay in collecting fleets large enough to venture on their doubtful
                        ex</p>
                    <p>pedition, and the longer time occupied by junks in their voyages, must
                        unavoidably make it less onerous to the Chinese shippers to employ foreign
                        vessels, if no difficulty is thrown in the way by their authorities.</p>
                    <p>The feasibility of carrying out these views is at this moment being tested
                        here, by the shipment on Chinese account of produce in foreign vessels. The
                        Commissioner's récognition of the right of Chinese subjects to avail
                        themselves freight in foreign bottoms, made public by Her Majesty’s
                        Plenipotentiary, September, 1847, has unfortunately not reached the Taoutae
                        through the proper official channel ; and before any final ar-rangements can
                        be entered into in reference to the produce now in port, communication must
                        he had with Keying-</p>
                    <p>I assume that no question can be raised as to the right of Chinese shippers
                        to pay the duties on their own Produce according to the tariff in force for
                        Chinese subjects. This is not expressly stated in the Imperial
                        Commissioner’s communication</p>

                        contemplated. </p>
                    <p>Some difficulties of detail, if not of principle, may naturally be expected
                        to arise before a new trade such as this will</p>

                    <p>its importance both to Great Britain and China may well demand patient and
                        per-severing exertion, to ensure a successful</p>
                    <p>result. Access to the whole coast and Formosa would no doubt be required for
                        the full development of this carrying trade, but even under existing
                        arrangement, the five Ports will furnish a large contingent</p>
                    <p> Of foreign vessels at present employed on the coast, with the exception of a
                        few Spanish vessels already employed by the Chinese in the Straits’ trade
                        they may be considered as merely auxiliary to the direct European and Indian
                        trade. They are employed to equalise the supply of British goods at the
                        three ports, where they are in demand to convey opium up the coast and bring
                        returns of specie, the proceeds of the latter.</p>
                    <p>In reference to British trade with the Australian colonies, exports of timber
                        may soon supply a deficiency hitherto felt, and the resent modification in
                        the duty chargeable on unenumerated woods, reducing it from 10 pet cent, to
                        5 per cent., will facilitate shipments from thence. A similar reduction in
                        the prohibitive duty of 50 per cent, now levied on coarse China ware by our
                        tariff would probably lead at once to an export from Shanghae alone of China
                        ware to the value of some 300, 000 dollars per annum for the consumption of
                        the different islands, whose traders resort to Singapore for supplies from
                        China.</p>
                    <p>Other products besides timber may also lie found in our Australian
                        settlements to bring in exchange for tea, and another , link thus be added
                        to the commercial chain of wealthy and productive islands stretching across
                        the line from New Zealand to the China Sea. In the midst of these England
                        has already flourishing centres of trade and free ports, to the further
                        prosperity of which China, freed from the incubus of piracy now weighing
                        down the native trade and enhancing the value of all articles of
                        consumption, may be made to her own advantage to contribute.</p>
                    <p>As to the immediate prospects of a partial transfer of the Chinese carrying
                        trade at Shanghae, a beginning has been made by the successful exertions of
                        Messrs. Turner &amp; Co. This house, under the able management of Mr.
                        Stewart, to whom I am indebted for access to the fullest information upon
                        the subject, has led the way by shipments of sugar from the south, which
                        although probably not immediately or largely profitable to the house, is
                        nevertheless a step in the right direction fraught with advantage if
                        judiciously followed, as will be evident upon consideration of the following
                        facts.</p>
                    <p>From 300,000 to 500,000 piculs may be received as a safe estimate of the
                        annual importation of that article into the port. This is confirmed by the
                        extent of the operations into which it is found the sugar hongs are now
                        inclined to enter.</p>
                    <p>The chief places from whence it is im-ported are Formosa, the ports in the
                        Fo-keen Province, and Canton ; the proportion from the latter port must be
                        considerable, although there would seem to lie no doubt that the original
                        cost of the sugar is cheaper at other sources. The first transaction entered
                        into was the importation of 12,000 piculs from that port, and orders on
                        native account could have been immediately afterwards obtained for 50,000
                        more.</p>
                    <p>The great bulk of the demand here is for brown sugar of a low quality ; and
                        as the rapid and careful conveyance of this description, which melts and
                        loses weight considerably on long voyages, is a great element in its
                        successful out-turn, its import in European vessels from Hongkong or
                        elsewhere gives it an advantage which, enables it to compete successfully
                        with -the cheaper-bought but junk-borne sugar-</p>
                    <p>from the other places in these seas. For this, among other reasons, the finer
                        qualities of sugar which scarcely deteriorate imported from Hongkong appear
                        unable at present to compete with the junk sugars from Canton or the other
                        districts, the 5 per cent. import and export duty of our Tariff probably
                        turning the scale against us, but shipped on Chinese account this difficulty
                        may and I trust will disappear.</p>
                    <p>The collateral advantages to be derived from this new trade, should it prove
                        as successful as it promises, are numerous and important.</p>
                    <p>1. It will furnish in proportion to its extent another means, besides opium,
                        of laying down funds here, the difficulty attending which is one of the
                        great drawbacks to the trade of this port. The value of the whole annual
                        sugar import here may safely be taken at, 1,750,000 dollars. This will best
                        be seen thus :—</p>
                    <p>Gross value of imports in 54 vessels of 15,069 tons, in 1846 Drs.
                        3,888,000</p>

                    <p>The surplus value of exports over im-</p>
                    <p>port. was chiefly paid in opium, with the assistance of only half the present
                        import of sugar. The gross imports at Shanghae might stand thus :—</p>
                    <p>Value of miscellaneous imports in 54 vessels, 15,</p>
                    <p>069 tons, 1846 .Drs. 3,888,000</p>
                    <p>Ditto sugar, say 250,000 picul 15,000 tons 875,000</p>
                    <p>Drs. 4,763,000</p>
                    <p>2. From this estimate it will be seen that in time this single article of the
                        carrying trade may give profitable employment to double the amount of
                        shipping at present engaged in the Shanghae trade.</p>
                    <p>3. Amoy and its neighbourhood is likely to furnish the cheapest sugar for
                        this market, and could this sugar trade, in its character of simply a
                        carrying trade from one port of China to another, be relieved of the export
                        duty (which falls very heavily upon the lower qualities of sugar, equally 12
                        per cent.) the influence upon the trade of Amoy would be very important and
                        beneficial ; thus if we take—</p>

                        present Shanghae sugar imports would engage 5,000 tons and equal in value
                        294,000 dollars. '</p>
                    <p>It would thus find employment for the British vessels bringing cotton from
                        India and yam from England (the principal Amoy imports), taking them to a
                        port, Shanghae, where they would obtained return cargoes.</p>
                    <p>4. The trade hitherto carried on in junks between the east coast of China and
                        the Straits having, as has been shown, a tendency to fall into the hands of
                        Europeans, and to employ Foreign shipping, the addition of a large bulky
                        article like sugar, of steady and assured consumption must in all
                        probability greatly hasten this result, it being at present very difficult
                        to lead a vessel entirely with articles of Strait’s produce suitable for one
                        market.</p>
                    <p>It remains to be seen whether ultimately sugar cannot be imported cheaper
                        from Calcutta, Madras, Penang, and Singapore. But I have entered has fully
                        into the details of the experiment as far as it has extended, because I
                        think it furnishes the best illustration of the important results, direct
                        and indirect, to be anticipated from the transfer of a portion of the
                        carrying trade of the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Nor must it be overlooked that this branch of trade is calculated to give
                        very considerable activity to the local trade of Hongkong, and there seems
                        reason to believe that a portion of trade may be profitably diverted to
                        Ningpo by laying down sugar, imported in large quantities annually, and
                        taking in return green teas. It has been ascertained that these can be
                        obtained at Ningpo at 10 per cent. less than sugars would be received in
                        ex-, -change.- </p>
                    <p>In the beginning Mssrs. Turner &amp; Co.’s operations attracted little
                        attention and possibly were looked upon as losing transactions, but they
                        have answered the end in view ; and if the trade be not overdone this
                        season, its future success seems tolerably certain.</p>
                    <p>For the fullest development of this, as of every other branch of the coast
                        trade, as sugars are largely consumed here from numerous points of the
                        coast, free access to the whole coast of China as I have already remarked,
                        and especially to Formosa would be advantageous, as also a reduction of the
                        export duty of 2m. 5c. equal to 5 per cent, upon the sugar now imported, and
                        12 percent, upon the lower qualities. The Chinese transfer their sugar from
                        port to port at a duty of 2 to 3 per cent. The expediency of mooting any
                        question of this nature must however of course depend upon
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Hitherto the carelessness of the customhouse officers has obviated the
                        necessity for appeal upon—another question the</p>
                    <p>decision of which may exercise considerable influence upon the carrying trade
                        in foreign bottoms. Vessels employed exclusively in the coasting trade have
                        two or three times been allowed to come in and leave the port without
                        payment of tonnage dues, on production of a port clearance from Canton of
                        some anterior date.</p>
                    <p>It is contended by some British merchants that they are exempted under these
                        circumstances by the XVth. clause of the French Treaty, where it is laid
                        down that “ lors du paiement du droit précité, le Chef de la Douane
                        délivrera au Capitaine ou Consignataire, un reçu en forme de certificat,
                        constatant que le droit de tonnage a été intégralement acquitté : et sur
                        l’exhibition de ce certificat au Chef de la Douane de tout afutre des Cinq
                        Ports où il lui conviendrait de se rendre, le Capitaine sera dispensé de
                        payer de nouveau pour son bâtiment le droit de tonnage, tout navire Français
                        ne devant en être passible qu’une seule fois à chacun de ses voyages d’un
                        pays étranger en Chine.”— and so long as they are merely transferring goods
                        from one Chinese, port to</p>
                    <p>another, they are entitled to demand free</p>
                    <p>clearances for any vessel so long as she does not touch at any foreign port—
                        Hongkong to wit.</p>
                    <p>In the event of this reading being confirmed, it : will be seen that much of
                        our coast and carrying trade may he exempted from tonnage dues, by avoiding
                        the port of Hongkong.</p>
                    <p>The facts referred to in this report would seem satisfactorily to bear out
                        the inference that the maritime trade of China, though still large, is
                        decaying in all its more valuable elements, the dread of loss and danger
                        from pirates diverting inland all portable and more costly articles to the
                        great enhancement of price to the consumer and probably diminution of profit
                        to the shipper.</p>
                    <p>The experience we have had of the eagerness with which the Chinese merchants
                        avail themselves of foreign tonnage at Amoy, and latterly here, may be taken
                        as good evidence of the tendency of these long-existing evils to throw no
                        small portion of the trade into European hands.</p>
                    <p>The beneficial result to both the Chinese people and ourselves of such
                        partial transfer as has been contemplated does not admit of question, and
                        seems at least as important in a political as a commercial point of
                        view.</p>
                    <p>It must be in every way important, therefore, to watch the first development
                        of this carrying trade at the different ports, and zealously protect it from
                        any unfair and covert interference on the part of the Chinese authorities,
                        the greatest danger to which it is exposed.</p>

                    <head>History of the Conquest of China by the - Manchu Tartars, by M, Vojeu de
                        Binnem, Lyons, 1754. ( Continued from No. 22. )</head>
                    <p>Some days after the publication of these regulations, the whole army set
                        forward. It passed the great wall without meeting with the least opposition,
                        and entered into the empire of China the twenty-fifth day of the tenth
                        moon,* that is to say towards the middle of the month of December 1629. The
                        left wing advanced as far as Haneulkoang a tolerably strong post, which the
                        Manchus determined to blockade. But the Governor was not a man who would
                        permit himself to be shut up so easily. He sallied forth from the place with
                        the best part of his garrison, and boldly charged the first Tartars he
                        encountered. The latter stood firm, and the remainder of their troops having
                        arrived in time to succour them, they cut the Chinese detachment to
                        pieces.</p>
                    <p>The lieutenant of the Governor who had remained within Haneulkoang, had no
                        sooner learned the defeat of his General, than he cut off his hair according
                        to the Manchu fashion, and introduced them within the fort.</p>
                    <p>The Mandarin who commanded at Tehinkiakeou, acted in a manner still more
                        cowardly. He went out to meet Taytsong who was at the head of the right
                        wing, gave him up the keys of that fort, and yielded himself prisoner with
                        all his men.</p>
                    <p>It was not thus with the noble Man-, darin who resided at Tsunhoatcheou,§ in
                        quality of Viceroy of one part of Petcheli. As there was no prospect that he
                        would yield himself of his own accord Taytsong was desirous to obtain his
                        submission by writing to him. His letter was urgent and allowed no reply,
                        seeing how powerless they were within the city to make any protracted
                        resistance against the assaults of the Tartars. But the unlucky Viceroy
                        could not make up his mind to so open an act of infidelity, the example of
                        which must be very pernicious at the present conjuncture. He took the
                        resolution therefore to hang himself in despair, and the inhabitants of
                        Tsunhoa immediately opened their gates.</p>
                    <p>The greater part of the Tartar army</p>
                    <p>united around this fortress, whence it</p>
                    <p>made a rapid march towards Pekin. They were already pretty near to it, when
                        Taytsong published the following manifesto, addressed to all the Chinese
                        :—</p>
                    <p>“ The Emperor of the Manchus, to the Mandarins, soldiers and people of
                        China.”</p>
                    <p>“It is not long since that we were on the confines of your empire, where we
                        lived, as you well know, a submissive and faithful people. There we formed
                        formerly but one peuple under Yehé, when it pleased one of your Emperors to
                        divide it into two parts and give the best</p>
                    <p>* The Chinese year contains twelve lunar months, each of twenty-nine and
                        thirty days alternately; but, in order to adjust these lunations with the
                        course of the sun, they occasionally add an intercalary month. The year
                        always begins at the new moon the nearest to the 15th degree of Aquarius;
                        which Is likewise the commencement of the Chinese Spring.</p>
                    <p> Haneulkoang is situated on the gulf of Leaotong or of Petcheli, in the 38
                        deg. 20 m. of North Latitude and in the 135 deg. 22 m. of Longitude (East of
                        Paris).</p>
                    <p> *This post is not to lie confounded with the celebrated passage of
                        Chankiakeou, too distant for Taytsong to have moved against that
                        station.</p>
                    <p>* Tsunhoa in Petcheli, is a city of thé second order, as the final syllable
                        Tcheou signified, its situation is towards the. 40 deg. of North Latitude,
                        and the 185 deg. 49 m. of Longitude (East of Paris....)</p>
                    <p>to Yehe it is one of the grievances of which we have frequently complained,
                        without ever having obtained redress. Thereupon we appealed to Heaven,
                        before the beginning of the war; and Heaven has approved it, as you see, in
                        giving us possession of the whole country that extends to the east of the
                        river. ”</p>
                    <p>“ Taytsou, my august father, content with having achieved this conquest, and
                        breathing forth only peace, wrote to your Court** which did not deign to
                        reply to his letter. War having recommenced, Heaven has continued to favour
                        us up to the present time : whatever is situated to the west of the river,
                        has fallen into our hands. Whatever advantage We have gained, peace has been
                        the object of My wishes. I have neglected nothing to establish peace with
                        you : as my letters testify. Not only has no notice been taken of them ; but
                        We have been contemned, even to indignity, whereupon, after having again
                        addressed Heaven, I again took up arms ; and by the success which has
                        attended them, your Court ought to allow, that it took a very wrong
                        part.”</p>
                    <p>“ You Mandarins, soldiers and people of China, know that they amongst you who
                        will submit willingly to me, shall receive more honours and riches, than
                        they ever enjoyed under the dynasty of Ming. But likewise all they who shall
                        refuse to submit, shall be put to death without mercy: and do not you lay
                        the blame to me ; it is not I who will condemn them to death, it is your
                        master and his Council.”</p>
                    <p>“ They reproach me that a Prince of a State so small as mine, never ought to
                        arrogate to himself the title of Ti (Emperor), but I reply that the Leao,
                        the Kin and the Yuen originally possessed but a very small country,that
                        they, nevertheless, bore the title of Ti, and made themselves masters of
                        China wholly or in part. The founder even of the dynasty of the Mings, who
                        was he ? A Hochang Bonze* whom Heaven willed should be raised to the throne:
                        for Heaven raises whomsoever he pleases. Who knows, whether He has not
                        chosen me to become one day your master, and to succeed to the Princes of
                        Ming?"</p>
                    <p>( To be continued. )</p>
                    <p>* This people of Yehé can only be a remnant of the ancient Kingdom of Hya
                        destroyed by Genghiskhan. It was situated to the north of the province of
                        Chensi beyond the great wall.</p>
                    <p>* The river here mentioned is the Lyau, which divides Leaotong into two

                    <p>** This does not agree with what is said at the beginning of this history, if
                        one does not suppose that Taytsou wrote twice to make peace ; for at the
                        time of his first letter, he had not conquered the eastern part of
                        Leaotong.</p>
                    <p>** The name of Bonze means generally the priests and other ministers of the
                        idolatrous worship both of China and Japan. They mostly live in common.
                        There are also Bonzesses who live in houses apart from the men ; who however
                        keep within their precincts lint indifferently. All the Bonzes are either
                        Lamas or Ho-changs. The Lamas came originally from Tartary, and the Hochangs
                        from India, both profess to worship the idol Fo. The hierarchical order is
                        more sensible a-</p>

                    <p>Population,—Bali contains about 1,000, 000 inhabitants, and as they arc
                        remarkable for their industrious habits and the comparative advances they
                        have made in agricultural and manufacturing arts, must be considered as the
                        most important of all the independent nations of the Indian Archipelago. The
                        proportion of people to the square mile is stated by Dutch authorities to be
                        double in amount to that of Java. Although the island is divided into
                        several petty states under different chiefs, a certain degree of combination
                        is created by their all acknowledging the supremacy of the Dewa Agong of
                        Klon-kong, the royal family of which state is said to be lineally descended
                        from an ancient chief whose authority was formerly paramount throughout the
                        island, and indeed extended to the western side of Lombok.</p>
                    <p>The Balinese are a purely agricultural people, and shew a decided aversion to
                        a</p>
                    <p>sea-faring life, never venturing abroad on trading voyages, but disposing of

                    <p>strangers whom it serves to attract. In their physical characteristics they
                        are distinct from all other tribes of the Indian Archipelago with the
                        exception of those of the neighbouring island Lombok, that is to say those
                        of Balinese origin, for the Sasak, or aborigines of Lombok, are evidently
                        identical with the Bugis, Molucca:, islanders, and other Malayu-Polynesian
                        tribes of the Archipelago. The Balinese are fairer in complexion, and of
                        more lofty stature, than either the Bugis or Javanese, and the stiff, wiry
                        nature of their hair, more resembles that of the Mongolians of continental
                        Asia than of any other people. These circumstances, coupled with the fact of
                        the great bulk of the population professing the Hindu religion, has given
                        rise to many speculations as to the origin of their civilization. The same
                        religion is known to have formerly spread over Java, and is supposed to have
                        been introduced from the Indian peninsula, which was probably the case; but
                        Balinese civilization has evidently been derived from a different source, as
                        the accounts of all travellers who have visited tlie island from Java, teem
                        with details of the striking pointe of difference in the characteristics of
                        the two people. From opportunities I have had of comparison, I am inclined
                        to believe that a very close connection formerly existed between the people
                        of Bali and Siam. In their physical characteristics the resemblance is
                        almost perfect, in fact the excellent sketch of a Balinese in Mr. Crawfurd’s
                        History of the Indian Archipelago, even to the mode and arrangement of the
                        dress, would form a perfectly correct representation of one of the lower
                        class in Siam. The style of the houses in Bali, surrounded by walls of brick
                        ;—the form of religion ;—the custom of writing on the leaves of the lontar
                        palm by means of an iron style; —the mode of disposing of deceased princes
                        by burning the bodies on lofty piles ;—the entire system of agriculture,
                        even to the maintaining large herds ol ducks to drive over the cropped paddy
                        fields, and whose eggs are collected and salted to form an article of export
                        ;—the custom of both sexes leaving the body from the waist upwards
                        uncovered, (except on occasions of going abroad, where the females wear a
                        salendong or scar thrown loosely over the shoulders and across the breast),
                        are all identical with those of the Siamese. The court ceremonies, also,
                        very closely correspond The crawling motion by which even a chief approaches
                        his sovereign, first casting loose a long piece of cloth attached to his
                        girdle as a train, is practiced by both people. The Balinese princes are
                        unable to obtain white elephants to grace their studs like the Kings of
                        Siam, but they adopt as substitutes the albino variety of the buffalo, a
                        pair of which is attached to nearly every court.</p>
                    <p>Whatever may have been their origin, there can be no doubt that they are a
                        highly intelligent and improvable people, and if they succeed in maintaining
                        their independence, will no doubt assume a high position among the petty
                        nations of the Archipelago. As Islamism, although it has made some progress
                        in the sea ports,</p>
                    <p>has by no means obtained an ascendancy, the Balinese are the more inclined to
                        seek the friendship of Europeans. The slave trade formerly existed in Bali
                        to an enormous extent, but since the Dutch have made the transport of slaves
                        by sea illegal, it has nearly ceased. Great numbers were exported to Java,
                        and even to the Mauritius. At the former place many of the females became
                        the wives of Chinese, who seem to prefer connecting themselves with Balinese
                        than with any other of the island races, (To be continued.)</p>
