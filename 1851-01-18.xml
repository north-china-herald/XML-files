                    <head>To the Editor of the "North-China Herald."</head>
                    <p>Mr. Editor,—In looking over a late file of California papers my attention was
                        arrested by a call for a public meeting to take into consideration “ the
                        necessity of urging upon the central government, the establishment of a line
                        of Steamers across the Pacific ocean,” and as one of your correspondents, in
                        the last number of your paper has availed of your columns to give publicity
                        to a few very sensible remarks respecting our present Steam communication,
                        it has occurred to me a few words, at this time, upon this projected Pacific
                        line might not be unaccepta-</p>
                    <p>ble.</p>
                    <p>Dependent as we are now, upon the orders of a single Board of Directors for
                        what few facilities we enjoy, I fancy there are but few of our Community who
                        would not like to see the time when the appearance of a Steamer in our port,
                        might be looked upon as a weekly certainty instead of a monthly, possibility
                        : there appears but little likelihood, that any Company will start up in the
                        west, to rival the present monopolisers of the Indian Steam communication,
                        and until our port becomes of sufficient importance to make it an object to
                        keep a Steamer on the coast, we are liable at any time</p>
                    <p>to be deprived of what is now allotted us. Sincerely hoping such may not he
                        the case let us turn our attention eastward and see what has been done, and
                        what is proposed to be done, in our behalf. It has been the general
                        impression among foreigners in China for sometime past, that we were to have
                        a line of Steamers across from California though probably but few are aware
                        that any very decided steps have ever been taken, to bring this about.
                        Shortly after the close of the Mexican War (in December 1848) this matter
                        was brought before the American Congress, and the Committee to whom it was
                        referred reported so favourably upon it, that oilers were issued to the
                        Commanders of the Pacific and East India Squadrons, to ascertain, what
                        quantity of coals might be obtained in the vicinity of the proposed route :
                        the Commander of the first named fleet could only report what was already
                        known that an abundance of coals might be obtained from Vancouver’s Island
                        and its vicinity, but the scarcity of laboring men, for California, rendered
                        these mines useless.</p>
                    <p>Upon the receipt of the order in China the brig Dolphin was sent to the only
                        known coal mines of any extent in our vicinity, to Kelung, on the north end
                        of Formosa : but little difficulty was ex-</p>
                    <p>perienced in finding the mine which they reported as situated near the bank
                        of the river twelve miles from the anchorage, that it would probably yield
                        an all sufficient supply of coals of very good quality (in appearance much
                        resembling the Kennel Coal) but the right of working the mine was claimed by
                        the Governor of Fokeen province, without whose consent it would be useless
                        to attempt to get any : the pecul of coals brought away, cost them 10
                        dollars, and the Committee appointed by Congress, apparently disgusted at
                        the price of fuel in our parts, rendered their report and quietly retired.
                        Since that time the many more important matters to be arranged, have quite
                        set aside the reconsideration of this to us important topic ; until our
                        kindred across the water, weary of slavery debates, have gathered together
                        and cried out to Congress to attend to them : it may be leaning upon rather
                        a weak reed, but we have strong hopes that even if nothing is done upon this
                        side, the energy and perseverance of the citizens of San Fran-sisco will yet
                        accomplish much in this matter.</p>
                    <p>At the rate at which the distance between Panama and San Francisco is
                        accomplished at present, it would require about 25 days between the latter
                        place and our port. It has been evident all along that some intermediate
                        coal depot must be established upon some of the Islands in the Pacific and
                        the Fox or Bonin isles were referred to in the meeting in San Francisco: but
                        from what was stated there by the Captains of whalers, it appears that their
                        open roadsteads and fog enveloped shores, are not likely to be the places
                        most favourable : the evidence was so conclusive that a damper was evidently
                        thrown upon the meeting until some one cried out Japan. We should regret to
                        find that in those who attended this meeting the inborn desire of Americans
                        to go west, had not been satisfied by a trip to California : although
                        whatever they may do in the furthering the establishment of the line of
                        steamers we trust may have its due effect.</p>
                    <p>It may be argued that there is no traffic to support such a line and without
                        the assistance of Government it is allowed it would be a losing business.
                        But when</p>
                    <p>it is borne in mind that San Francisco is now the depôt for Chinese goods for
                        all the ports on the western coasts of America it will be acknowledged that
                        the amount of Silk freight, would monthly be no inconsiderable amount. As it
                        would be only on the finer and more expensive articles of merchandise such
                        as Silks &amp;c., that could afford to be sent in this manner, it appears
                        that for a time our desired line of steamers would only serve to build up
                        the trade of Canton, though from the fact that the manufactures there have
                        reached their present pitch of excellence by the teaching of the foreigners
                        with whom they deal, we should be well content in the long run to leave this
                        matter in the hands of many of those around us.</p>
                    <p>It now only remains for us to enquire if something cannot be done from here
                        in furtherance of this object. Our friends upon the other shore have taken
                        the matter up as if they were not inclined to leave it and a voice from this
                        quarter we have no doubt would be acceptable. In the debates in their
                        meeting we find no allusion made to any on this unfortunate side who may
                        benefit by their undertaking, or who are even watching their progress with
                        feelings of interest. Apparently astonished at their own rapid advancement,
                        they overlook the fact that there is a growing community on this side to
                        whom the proposed plan is of much more real importance than even to
                        themselves. It may be that a Circular for shares in such a company might
                        meet with questionable success among us, but as yet we are called upon for
                        no such display of enterprise, and a few words of encouragement to the
                        citizens of California could do no harm, and would naturally give an
                        increased interest to their proceedings. Hitherto we have been apparently
                        unconcerned spectators of the progress of this movement but with a firm
                        conviction that we can aid and assist the enterprise I have availed of your
                        columns to bring the subject forward. With a proper appreciation of the
                        talents of many of my countrymen, I am aware that all this would have been
                        much better said by some one else, but if it only has the effect of bringing
                        the matter into more general consideration it will gratify the wish of more
                        then one.</p>

                        Shirtings, has given greater firmness to the market, and prices have
                        advanced. The rise in low reeds and in 72s. may be quoted as from 6 to 12
                        cents, and in the medium qualities 64s. to 66s. fully 15 cents.</p>

                        Looking to the comparatively small stocks of Grey Shirtings, the moderate
                        quantity expected to arrive, and the satisfactory account from the interior,
                        further improvement in prices may be anticipated. The low qualities of White
                        Shirtings, having been of late imported in excess may probably continue
                        depressed, till stocks become reduced. The better qualities are likely to be
                        in good request, and to command full prices.</p>

                    <p>Tea.—Since our last report 18th ultimo, we have to notice sales of about 30
                        chops Congou and Souchong, and 5 to 6,000 packages (chests and half-</p>
                    <p>chests) Green Teas; having in stock about 20 chops Black, and something under
                        4,000 packages Green, the latter almost exclusively Twankays and Hyson
                        Skin.</p>
                    <p>Total sales for the season about—</p>
                    <p>250,000 packages Black.</p>
                    <p>136,000 chests and half-chests Green.</p>
                    <p>The market continues to be fed by occasional arrivals, but there is little
                        reason to expect any large augmentation to the quality already brought
                        forward during the remainder of the season.</p>
                    <p>Early in the month prices of Black Teas particularly Congous, for two or
                        three of the better grades, had an upward tendency, at which the market was
                        cleared of all Congous, better than good ordinary. </p>
                    <p>We quote prices as in our last report. Gunpowders and Imperials of good
                        quality would command full rates.</p>

                    <p>Opium Report.</p>
                    <p>Maiwa.—Has been extremely dull all the month which may in a great measure be
                        attributed to the very heavy amount of money orders on the market, in fact
                        money orders have been almost the only method of effecting sales. </p>
                    <p>There was a slight improvement after the departure of the last mail, and some
                        100 chests were placed at about Drs. 690, but prices quickly declined and
                        have since ranged from Drs. 570 a 575 for best quality drug. The clearances
                        have been principally of Indore and inferior and may amount to say 1,100

                        and prices rapidly declined to Drs. 460, and even Drs. 440 was a nominal
                        quotation for low numbers. It was reported the Mazeppa drug was placed at
                        Drs. 450, previous to her arrival, which alarmed the buyers extremely,
                        present quotations Drs. 445 low, high numbers Drs. 454.</p>
                    <p>Delivery during the month 750 chests. Stock, tins day 500 chests. Some say
