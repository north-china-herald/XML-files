                    <head>To the Editor of the "North-China Herald."</head>
                    <p>Mr. Editor,—In looking over a late file of California papers my attention was
                        arrested by a call for a public meeting to take into consideration “ the
                        necessity of urging upon the central government, the establishment of a line
                        of Steamers across the Pacific ocean,” and as one of your correspondents, in
                        the last number of your paper has availed of your columns to give publicity
                        to a few very sensible remarks respecting our present Steam communication,
                        it has occurred to me a few words, at this time, upon this projected Pacific
                        line might not be unaccepta-</p>
                    <p>ble.</p>
                    <p>Dependent as we are now, upon the orders of a single Board of Directors for
                        what few facilities we enjoy, I fancy there are but few of our Community who
                        would not like to see the time when the appearance of a Steamer in our port,
                        might be looked upon as a weekly certainty instead of a monthly, possibility
                        : there appears but little likelihood, that any Company will start up in the
                        west, to rival the present monopolisers of the Indian Steam communication,
                        and until our port becomes of sufficient importance to make it an object to
                        keep a Steamer on the coast, we are liable at any time</p>
                    <p>to be deprived of what is now allotted us. Sincerely hoping such may not he
                        the case let us turn our attention eastward and see what has been done, and
                        what is proposed to be done, in our behalf. It has been the general
                        impression among foreigners in China for sometime past, that we were to have
                        a line of Steamers across from California though probably but few are aware
                        that any very decided steps have ever been taken, to bring this about.
                        Shortly after the close of the Mexican War (in December 1848) this matter
                        was brought before the American Congress, and the Committee to whom it was
                        referred reported so favourably upon it, that oilers were issued to the
                        Commanders of the Pacific and East India Squadrons, to ascertain, what
                        quantity of coals might be obtained in the vicinity of the proposed route :
                        the Commander of the first named fleet could only report what was already
                        known that an abundance of coals might be obtained from Vancouver’s Island
                        and its vicinity, but the scarcity of laboring men, for California, rendered
                        these mines useless.</p>
                    <p>Upon the receipt of the order in China the brig Dolphin was sent to the only
                        known coal mines of any extent in our vicinity, to Kelung, on the north end
                        of Formosa : but little difficulty was ex-</p>
                    <p>perienced in finding the mine which they reported as situated near the bank
                        of the river twelve miles from the anchorage, that it would probably yield
                        an all sufficient supply of coals of very good quality (in appearance much
                        resembling the Kennel Coal) but the right of working the mine was claimed by
                        the Governor of Fokeen province, without whose consent it would be useless
                        to attempt to get any : the pecul of coals brought away, cost them 10
                        dollars, and the Committee appointed by Congress, apparently disgusted at
                        the price of fuel in our parts, rendered their report and quietly retired.
                        Since that time the many more important matters to be arranged, have quite
                        set aside the reconsideration of this to us important topic ; until our
                        kindred across the water, weary of slavery debates, have gathered together
                        and cried out to Congress to attend to them : it may be leaning upon rather
                        a weak reed, but we have strong hopes that even if nothing is done upon this
                        side, the energy and perseverance of the citizens of San Fran-sisco will yet
                        accomplish much in this matter.</p>
                    <p>At the rate at which the distance between Panama and San Francisco is
                        accomplished at present, it would require about 25 days between the latter
                        place and our port. It has been evident all along that some intermediate
                        coal depot must be established upon some of the Islands in the Pacific and
                        the Fox or Bonin isles were referred to in the meeting in San Francisco: but
                        from what was stated there by the Captains of whalers, it appears that their
                        open roadsteads and fog enveloped shores, are not likely to be the places
                        most favourable : the evidence was so conclusive that a damper was evidently
                        thrown upon the meeting until some one cried out Japan. We should regret to
                        find that in those who attended this meeting the inborn desire of Americans
                        to go west, had not been satisfied by a trip to California : although
                        whatever they may do in the furthering the establishment of the line of
                        steamers we trust may have its due effect.</p>
                    <p>It may be argued that there is no traffic to support such a line and without
                        the assistance of Government it is allowed it would be a losing business.
                        But when</p>
                    <p>it is borne in mind that San Francisco is now the depôt for Chinese goods for
                        all the ports on the western coasts of America it will be acknowledged that
                        the amount of Silk freight, would monthly be no inconsiderable amount. As it
                        would be only on the finer and more expensive articles of merchandise such
                        as Silks &amp;c., that could afford to be sent in this manner, it appears
                        that for a time our desired line of steamers would only serve to build up
                        the trade of Canton, though from the fact that the manufactures there have
                        reached their present pitch of excellence by the teaching of the foreigners
                        with whom they deal, we should be well content in the long run to leave this
                        matter in the hands of many of those around us.</p>
                    <p>It now only remains for us to enquire if something cannot be done from here
                        in furtherance of this object. Our friends upon the other shore have taken
                        the matter up as if they were not inclined to leave it and a voice from this
                        quarter we have no doubt would be acceptable. In the debates in their
                        meeting we find no allusion made to any on this unfortunate side who may
                        benefit by their undertaking, or who are even watching their progress with
                        feelings of interest. Apparently astonished at their own rapid advancement,
                        they overlook the fact that there is a growing community on this side to
                        whom the proposed plan is of much more real importance than even to
                        themselves. It may be that a Circular for shares in such a company might
                        meet with questionable success among us, but as yet we are called upon for
                        no such display of enterprise, and a few words of encouragement to the
                        citizens of California could do no harm, and would naturally give an
                        increased interest to their proceedings. Hitherto we have been apparently
                        unconcerned spectators of the progress of this movement but with a firm
                        conviction that we can aid and assist the enterprise I have availed of your
                        columns to bring the subject forward. With a proper appreciation of the
                        talents of many of my countrymen, I am aware that all this would have been
                        much better said by some one else, but if it only has the effect of bringing
                        the matter into more general consideration it will gratify the wish of more
                        then one.</p>

                        Shirtings, has given greater firmness to the market, and prices have
                        advanced. The rise in low reeds and in 72s. may be quoted as from 6 to 12
                        cents, and in the medium qualities 64s. to 66s. fully 15 cents.</p>

                        quantity expected to arrive, and the satisfactory account from the interior,
                        further improvement in prices may be anticipated. The low qualities of White
                        Shirtings, having been of late imported in excess may probably continue
                        depressed, till stocks become reduced. The better qualities are likely to be
                        in good request, and to command full prices.</p>

                    <p>Tea.—Since our last report 18th ultimo, we have to notice sales of about 30
                        chops Congou and Souchong, and 5 to 6,000 packages (chests and half-</p>
                    <p>chests) Green Teas; having in stock about 20 chops Black, and something under
                        4,000 packages Green, the latter almost exclusively Twankays and Hyson
                        Skin.</p>
                    <p>Total sales for the season about—</p>
                    <p>250,000 packages Black.</p>
                    <p>136,000 chests and half-chests Green.</p>
                    <p>The market continues to be fed by occasional arrivals, but there is little
                        reason to expect any large augmentation to the quality already brought
                        forward during the remainder of the season.</p>
                    <p>Early in the month prices of Black Teas particularly Congous, for two or
                        three of the better grades, had an upward tendency, at which the market was
                        cleared of all Congous, better than good ordinary. </p>
                    <p>We quote prices as in our last report. Gunpowders and Imperials of good
                        quality would command full rates.</p>

                    <p>Opium Report.</p>
                    <p>Maiwa.—Has been extremely dull all the month which may in a great measure be
                        attributed to the very heavy amount of money orders on the market, in fact
                        money orders have been almost the only method of effecting sales. </p>
                    <p>There was a slight improvement after the departure of the last mail, and some
                        100 chests were placed at about Drs. 690, but prices quickly declined and
                        have since ranged from Drs. 570 a 575 for best quality drug. The clearances
                        have been principally of Indore and inferior and may amount to say 1,100
                        chests having a Stock, this day, of 1,300.</p>
                    <p>Patna.—Continue to rule at Drs. 590 from the last mail, until the arrival of
                        Lady Mary Wood bringing 400 chests, when holders were eager to effect sales,
                        and prices rapidly declined to Drs. 460, and even Drs. 440 was a nominal
                        quotation for low numbers. It was reported the Mazeppa drug was placed at
                        Drs. 450, previous to her arrival, which alarmed the buyers extremely,
                        present quotations Drs. 445 low, high numbers Drs. 454.</p>
                    <p>Delivery during the month 750 chests. Stock, tins day 500 chests. Some say

                    <p>We have inserted a letter from a Correspondent, who signs his communication A
                        British Merchant</p>
                    <p>Its publication must not be accepted as an approval by us of his opinions;
                        indeed if he be a party interested in the affair referred to; we think he
                        ought to congratulate himself on the Consular lenity, exhibited on that
                        occasion.</p>
                    <p>We admit that the Supplementary Treaty is of an exceptional character to the
                        whole course hitherto of British policy; and may further add, that it
                        imposes most unpleasant, but onerous duties on our Consuls; still the Treaty
                        exists, and manifestly must be en forced, if public faith is to be kept with
                        the Chinese Government.</p>

                    <p>The "condemnatory Edict” of which the following is a translation, first
                        reached Shanghae about a fortnight ago. Since then, various versions of it
                        have circulated among the respectable classes of natives, by whom it has
                        been received as an authentic document,—an opinion which has at length been
                        put beyond a question by its appearance in one of the last Pekin Reporters
                        from which this translation has been made.</p>
                    <p>As the sentence of an Emperor condemning to irretrievable disgrace and
                        degradation, the two statesmen of China to whom we have been accustomed
                        principally to look with any shadow of hope for a more liberal feel ing
                        towards "the foreigners from a far,” and as the first glimmering of</p>
                    <p>youthful successor, it conveys tidings of the deepest interest; while its sum
                        mary and tyrannical character prepares us for further measures, which will
                        no doubt in one way or other materially affect foreign intercourse with His
                        Imperial Majesty's subjects.</p>
                    <p>Totally in the dark as to the movements of the political world at Peking, we
                        cannot guess at the originating cause of so sudden and severe a
                        con-.demnation of two men but lately enjoying their Sovereign's highest
                        favor and implicit confidence, and, if one may judge from their position,
                        possessed of unbounded influence. But the invidious comparison instituted by
                        His Imperial Majesty between the patriotism of Tahunga，the butcher of our
                        Formosan captives, the Haynau of China,—and the treason of Keying, the
                        framer of our treaty and introducer of our commerce, leads us to believe
                        that a party diametrically opposed to foreign interests has</p>
                    <p>gained the ascendancy in the Imperial councils. That this is the case seems
                        pretty evident from the favor with which Lin is spoken of; and we know not
                        what important influence the late</p>
                    <p>decease of that Enemy of England may have on the future proceedings of the
                        Imperial Court. We have every reason to be anxious for the result.</p>
                    <p>We trust, however, that our authorities will not see fit to disregard this
                        index of the Imperial policy towards us.</p>
                    <p>Documents such as this, though in the main but pompous effusions of ignorant
                        conceit, go far to prove the true feelings and intentions cherished by China
                        towards England, notwithstanding the solemn compact by which she is bound ;
                        and, if not constantly and strongly animadverted upon, in the official
                        communications with the Imperial Commissioner at Canton, their promulgators
                        will gain fresh courage with every fulmination, and will, no doubt,
                        eventually proceed to adopt measures deeply injurious to our general
                        commerce, if not actually prejudicial to our position at the ports of
                        trade.</p>
                    <p>Firm, decided, and timely expostulation may prevent, what it will take
                        hostile measures in the end to cure; and it would be well if our Higher
                        authorities were less ready to prove themselves wrong and our opponents
                        faultless than a late proclamation supporting the prevarications of
                        Commissioner Seu has shown them to be.</p>
                    <p>PEKING，10/A moon, 28th day. (Sunday Dec. 1st, 1850.)</p>
                    <p>A decree, condemnatory of Muhchanga and</p>
                    <p> K'eying, has been issued under the hand and seal</p>
                    <p> of His Imperial Majesty, couched in the following terms:—</p>
                    <p> The duty, which chiefly devolves upon the</p>
                    <p>Ruler of a people, is, on the one hand to nominate men of merit, and, on the
                        other, to remove from office those who are devoid of all sound principle.
                        But to perform the latter part of our duty with partiality will necessarily
                        be at-tended by an indifferent execution of the former.</p>
                    <p>Looking at the prc«eut state of affairs, however, the Empire may be said to
                        be in a woful state of decline; for the officials are, in the administration
                        of Government, daily becoming more inef-ilcient, and the affections of the
                        people are growing more and more estranged, </p>
                    <p>This doubtless is in a great measure Our own fault. Yet, We feel that, to
                        assist us in the intricate task of electing for office those who are duly
                        qualified, or rejecting those who are incompetent, is a responsibility that
                        rests with our Ministers of state.,</p>
                    <p>Our Minister, Muhchanga, although he has been in high favour at Court during
                        several sue-cessive Reigns, appears never to have thought that to embody our
                        views and feelings in the ex-ecutive part of the Government, was his serious
                        and solemn duty. His only aim seems to have been to secure to himself both
                        rank and renown; and, with this end, he has stood in the way of the
                        promotion of men of worth and injured the best interests of these realms. He
                        is a man, in whose fidelity little confidence can be placed, for, assuming
                        an obsequious demea-nour, he only seeks to effect his crafty ends ； and,
                        being an individual of fictitious accomplishments, he with cringing
                        servility succumbs in every instance to his Sovereign, hoping thereby to
                        gain Imperial favor and influence. When our difficulties with the barbarians
                        first arose, how painstaking was Muhchanga in ridding himself of all who
                        happened not to be in his interest! The recollection of this fills us with
                        burning indignation. A notorious instance of this occurred at that time when
                        he was bent upon the ruin of Tah-hnng-nga and Yaou-yung who, by their
                        fidelity and diligence in Government, were checks upon his policy ； while he
                        lent all bis influence to support Keying —a man who, unblushingly and
                        without scruple, co-operated with him in carrying out all his base
                        schemes.</p>
                    <p>and prostitution of Imperial power are without parallel!</p>
                    <p>The deceased Emperor, our revered Parent, himself a pattern of the strictest
                        integrity, had a nature that could only treat man with unsuspecting
                        confidence, and Muhchanga fearlessly took advantage of this to secure his
                        own selfish purposes. But, had the Superior Intelligence of our honoured
                        Parent for a moment suspected the perfidy of that man’s heart, His Majesty
                        would, without doubt, have visited him with condign punishment </p>
                    <p> This Muhchanga, still presuming upon our</p>
                    <p>grace and favor, has from first to last persisted in his irregularities.</p>
                    <p>On the 1st month of the present year, when we took the reins of Government,
                        we found him, in transacting public business connected with the state,
                        either undecided and unable to form an opinion, or doggedly silent and
                        unwilling to give it, until at length in a few months, his wily policy
                        gradually came to light For instance， when the ships of the English
                        barbarians reached Tien-tsint he was exceedingly anxious to bring Keying
                        forward as his Colleague in carrying out his purposes and again involving
                        the subjects of these realms in bitter and disastrous turmoils.</p>
                    <p>Without a question then, he is a deep, dangerous intriguer, whose designs can
                        never be easily fathomed.</p>
                    <p>Recently too when Pwan-she-gan and his party recommended Lihtsihscu to us,
                        Muhchanga re-</p>
                    <p> peatedly assured us that Lintsihseu was disabled by infirmity and disease as
                        to be entirely unfit for active duty； and, when we had determined to tend to
                        Kwangse to crush the insurrections there, Muchanga persisted in throwing out
                        his</p>
                    <p>suspicions that Lin would not be able to proceed</p>
                    <p>on his mission.</p>
                    <p> Muhchanga, then, by fictitious representations, has deceived us and kept us
                        in ignorance of the real state of affairs around us. Herein lies the burden
                        of his offence.</p>
                    <p> As for Keying, his unpatriotic and pusillani-</p>
                    <p>mous policy is to Us a matter of unmixed astonishment. When he was at Canton,
                        for instance, he seemed only anxious to make our people subserve the
                        interests of foreigners,—all the while overlooking the claims of his native
                        country, Is not this evident from his proposal to throw open the gates of
                        that city,一whereby he violated the principles of heaven, outraged the
                        feelings of man, and all but introduced a series of innovations, the results
                        of which it is beyond human power to divine.</p>
                    <p>Our late lamented Parent, however, having seen through the duplicity of the
                        man, forthwith recalled him to the Capital ； and, although he did not at
                        once discard him from his service, only awaited a fit opportunity for doing
                        so.</p>
                    <p>Recently, during a private interview with Our-selves,一keying spoke freely to
                        Us of the English Foreigners how they were to be dreaded, and strongly urged
                        upon Us the necessity of a mild and conciliating policy, supposing that we
                        were not aware that his knawish object was merely to secure rank and
                        emolument for himself. Oh! how fallen and degraded is he；一the more he
                        speaks, the more we discover this,一so that at last we have the same contempt
                        for him that we should have for a wild yelping cur.</p>
                    <p> Muhchanga is a deep man, whom if is difficult to fathom: Keying is shallow
                        and easily found out: but their crime is one and the same,一they have
                        entailed disgrace and injury upon their country.</p>
                    <p>Were We, therefore, not to carry out the demands of the law,一would this be
                        ruling the people with proper selfrespect ? would this be fulfilling the
                        serious trust that has been put upon us by our Revered Parent ?</p>
                    <p> Yet, when we think of Muchanga, that he has been an old servant of the
                        Crown, under three successive reigns,——we cannot endure the thought of
                        bringing merited punishment upon him all at once. We, therefore, command
                        that the sentence be commuted for the more lenient penalty of deprivation of
                        all official rank and that henceforth he no longer be employed in the
                        service of the State. And as to Keying, although he is destitute of all
                        strength and firmness, yet he has been to some extent the creature of
                        circumstances ；一 We command therefore that leniency be shown him likewise,
                        and that he be degraded to the fifth rank, to await employment in one of the
                        six Boards.</p>
                    <p>That these two individuals have been deceiving their Sovereign, while they
                        have been promoting their own selfish interests, must be evident to the
                        whole empire; and yet we have not treated them with severe rigour, although
                        it has for a long time cost us intense anxiety of mind in deliberating how
                        to adjudicate the case.</p>
                    <p>Surely then, it must be allowed by all that we have been driven to this last
                        step by dire and painful necessity.</p>
                    <p>We trust, therefore, that in future the officials throughout these realms,
                        whether high or low, civil or military, will all, under the influence of
                        those noble principles derived from heaven, strive faithfully to maintain

                <div type="item"><head>Report from the Jews' Society</head>
                    <p>From a report the Jews’ Society of last year it appears that its Committee
                        had it in contemplation to send a Missionary to the Jews in China ; in
                        reference to which they say : “ Your Committee</p>
                    <p>have gladly availed themselves of the opportunity offered by the
                        establishment of the Bishopric of Victoria, Hongkong, to make further
                        inquiries respecting the Jews in China, and the practicability of esta-</p>
                    <p>appear to be peculiar difficulties in the way of the immediate realization of
                        their wishes in this respect, and their present efforts, must be limited to
                        a Mission of Inquiry, in which the Bishop has kindly promised his
                        assistance. That munificent friend of Israel, Miss Cook, has placed in the
                        hands of your Treasurer a sum sufficient to cover the amount of the expenses
                        occasioned by the establishment of the Mission.”</p>
                    <p>The Bishop of Victoria，on his arrival in Hongkong entered into a
                        correspon-dence with the Rev, W. H. Medhurst, in Shanghae, requesting his
                        assistance towards procuring information about the Jews in China, and
                        forwarding to him a string of queries on that subject. Mr. Medhurst revolved
                        the matter in bis mind, and was prepared with a plan, which on the expected
                        arrival of the Bishop in Shanghae he thought might be carried into
                        execution. The plan was this : to send two trustworthy individuals to</p>
                    <p>府封 k'hae-fung-foo the city where the Jews were supposed to be, to make
                        inquiries respecting their existence, and to bring down such information and
                        docu-</p>
                    <p>ments as could be easily procurable. The persons he had in view were native
                        Christians, trained under the auspices the London Missionary Society, one of
                        them a literary graduate from 鎭江府 Chin-keang-foo, and the other a young man
                        who bad been brought up in the Mission School at Batavia, could read and
                        write English, and after having had his Christian character tested by long
                        experience, had been already employed as a tract colporteur in the interior,
                        and given every satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>On the arrival of the Bishop in Shanghae, the plan and the persons to whom it
                        was to be intrusted were brought before his attention, while the journal
                        kept by the young man on a previous tour, and written in English, was
                        submitted to his inspection, "The Bishop was not long in perceiving the
                        propriety of the measure, and the persons alluded to, were despatched
                        accordingly. The name of the graduate was Tseang-yung-che, and that of the
                        young-man K'hew-t'heen-sang. The latter, though the youngest in years, was
                        made the principal agent in the affair, chiefly because from our long
                        acquaintance with his character we could place most confidence in him, and
                        because being able to write English he could give his own account of the
                        journey, which would be immediately intelligible to the lady who had
                        projected the scheme and advanced the funds.</p>
                    <p>On the 15th November last they started from Shanghae in a boat which was
                        engaged to convey them directly to</p>
                    <p>Ts'hing-keang-poo, a town situat*-ed in the prefecture of Hwae-</p>
                    <p>gnan-foo, on the banks of the grand canal, where it joins the Yellow river:
                        (Lat. 33.33. N., Long. 2.50 E. of Peking.) In order to reach this place they
                        availed themselves of the grand canal, which pas-ses through the cities of
                        Soo-chow,</p>
                    <p>常州 Chang-chow, and Chin-keang-foo, where it crosses the great river 洋子江
                        Yang-tsze-kcang, and pursues its course in a northerly direction past 楊州府
                        Yang-chow-foo, Kaou-yew, and 寶應 Paou-ying, until it reaches the Yellow
                        river. Arrived at that point they had to pursue their journey by land, for
                        which purpose they hired a cart, drawn by two mules, and following the
                        course of the Yellow river, sometiems on the north bank, and at other times
                        on the south, they reached the place of their destination. The travellers
                        represent the Yellow river, as at that season rather shallow, insomuch that
                        at one place it could be forded by means of a cart. Its banks, however, were
                        very high, and frequent indications appeared of its having overflowed the
                        same during the rainy season, as exhibited in the marshes and lakes which
                        abound along its course, in the midst of which garden trees and the remains
                        of ruined houses are to be seen. The country in the neighbourhood of the
                        river is in Consequence but thinly peopled, and the few inhabitants that are
                        left arc poor and miserable in the extreme. Places that figure on the map as
                        district cities presented to the travellers nothing but an assemblage of
                        thatched cottages, with the walls which once surrounded them entirely
                        demolished, and a solitary gateway here and there, tp tell of what once
                        existed. The roads were very rough, causing the cart to jolt excessively
                        :they led sometimes along the top of the bank, and at other times pursued
                        the bed of the stream, in those parts which had been left dry by the
                        receding tide. Here the cart was knee deep in sand, and there tumbling over
                        rugged stones. Their driver, whose good graces they were obliged to
                        propitiate, insisted on starting every morning at three or four o’clock,
                        which on the dark and cold winter days was anything but pleasant, and it was
                        generally midday before they could reach</p>
                    <p>a place where refreshments were to be procured. At the close of the day they
                        generally stopped to rest for the night, and yet with all those hours
                        employed in travelling, they did not make above twenty or thirty miles a
                        day. The cart sometimes went so slowly that the passengers were fain to get
                        out and walk, which they did much faster than the mules. At length after a
                        very tedious journey they arrived at K’hae-fung-foo (Lat. 34.55. N., Long.
                        1.50. W. of</p>
                    <p>Peking.)</p>
                    <p>They found many Mahomedans resid-ing there，who made no secret of their
                        religion, but wrote on their sign-boards the faith to which they belonged.
                        These Mussulmen were the principal tavern-keepers, and with one of them the
                        travel-lers put up. Their first inquiry was for the Jews, whom they asked
                        for under the designation of the</p>
                    <p>祧筋教 T’heaou-kin-keaou, or Pluck-sincw-religion; an appellation which had been
                        assumed or assigned in consequence of their plucking the chief sinew of the
                        legs of all animals slaughtered for food. See Gen. 32: 32、 The. Mahomedan
                        host immediately in-lormed them of the existence of the people</p>
                    <p>in question, and directed them to their synagogue. As it was late in the
                        evening, when they arrived, they deferred their visit to the next day: there
                        was no eulty in finding it: but "oh how changed how fallen!" from the time
                        when the Jesuit Missionanes visited it a century ago. The outer wall of the
                        inclosure was broken down, the front gate choked up with rubbish, the
                        monumental pillars, the in scription tablets, the stone balustrades in front
                        of the temples, and various other ornamental appendages broken or pros-</p>
                    <p>trated，and the very walls of the temple in many places dilapitated. The side
                        apartments which had been designed at Chapels in honour of the patriarchs
                        but poorly served to afford shelter to the few wretched sons of Israel who
                        were handled together to them, sleeping on the bare ground, with scarcely a
                        rag to cover them and barely sufficient to support nature. So much indeed
                        were they reduced in circumstances, that they had begun to dispose of the
                        fallen bricks and prostrate timbers of which the various apartments once
                        consisted, to procure for themselves the necessaries of life. Yea they had
                        gone</p>
                    <p>so far as to sell a piece of the ground of the</p>
                    <p>inclosure by which the temple was sur-rounded to the neighbouring heathen"
                        who were encroaching on iits precincts by their ever-enlarging pagan
                        temples. Yet there was enough to shew what had been its former glory. The
                        gateways and in-scriptions were still there: the holy place was in
                        existence, and its interior was beautifully decorated with gorgeous painting
                        and elaborate gildings. Our travel-lers entered the holiest of all, from
                        which polluted feet oc not now debarred, and saw the tubes Containing the
                        rolls of the law, which they unrolled and examined. These rolls, twelve in
                        number, were each about thirty feet in length, by two or three in width,
                        written on white sheep-skins, in a small character. But the room in which
                        they were found was so dark that our travellers could not examine them
                        thoroughly. Perhaps it may be asked, how it is that .strangers are now
                        permitted to intrude into the holy precincts, when a century ago, the Jesuit
                        Missionaries, backed with all the influence derived from the Imperial Court,
                        were not allowed to enter, or examine the records. The reply to this is
                        easy, and solves the difficulty they have had no rabbi for fifty years! and
                        there is not one of the professors of Judaism, in the present day in
                        K’hae-fung-foo, who can read one word of Hebrew. They have even discontinued
                        the practice of circumcision, and our travellers conceived that in a dozen
                        more years few or no traces of the Israelitish religion will there be found.
                        They did what they could, however, to rescue what remained from oblivion :
                        they gave money to the bystanders, and urged them to set up one of the two
                        inscription tablets in front of the temple, which had fallen down. This they
                        copied; as well as the writing that was traceable on the tablet that was
                        still standing. They took down memoranda of all the inscriptions yet
                        preserved over the door ways and in front of the temple: they even copied
                        the Hebrew inscriptions in the interior of the build-</p>
                    <p>ing, which are found to correspond ex-actly with those given by the Jesuit
                        Missionaries ;while they measured accurately the length and breadth of the
                        buildings, and brought away a very Intelligible ground-plan of the whole
                        inclosure, as well as of the interior of the principal building. The most
                        important achievement, however, and that which may tell on the interests of
                        religion and the science of biblical criticism is, the bringing away of
                        eight Hebrew manuscripts: six of them containing portions of the Old
                        Testament Scriptures: and two of them consisting of the liturgy used in the
                        weekly services of the Hebrew people, and on holiday occasions ;in which
                        latter documents also various portions of Scripture are to be met with. The
                        portions of Scripture are from the 1st to the 6th chapters of Exodus, from
                        the 38th to the 40th chapters of the same book, Leviticus 19th and 20th
                        chapters , Numbers 13th, 14th and 15th chapters, Deuteronomy- from the 11th
                        to the 16th chapters, with the 32nd chapter of that book. Various portions
                        of the Pentateuch, Psalms, and Hagiographa occiar in the books of prayers,
                        which have not yet been definitely fixed. The character in which these
                        portions are written is an antique form of the Hebrew, with points. They are
                        written on thick paper, evidently by means of a style, and the material
                        employed, as well as the silk in which the books are bound exhibit marks of
                        a foreign origin. Two Israelitish gentlemen, to whom they have been shewn in
                        Shang-hae, say that they have seen such books in Aden ; and the occurrence
                        here and there of Persian words, written with Hebrew letters, in the notes
                        appended，seem to indicate that the books in question came originally from
                        the western part of Asia, perhaps Persia or Arabia. There is no trace
                        whatever of the Chinese character about them, and they must have
                        manufactured entirely by foreigners residing in China, or who have come from
                        a foreign country. Regarding their age it would he difficult to hazard even
                        a conjecture. It is most likely that they are</p></div></div>
